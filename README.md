Users will be able to quickly retrieve information with regards to the films, characters and books. It is hoped that any one who visits this site can savour a bit of the grandeur of this aweseome series!

The ideal user for this site will be someone who enjoys the Lord of the Rings very much, and wishes to quickly obtain information about the films, characters or books. Anyone who has a general in the Lord of the Rings series should also be able to appreciate the information this site can provide.

The site design is clean and simple, and should be straightforward to navigate.
